This is a cross-platform project template. It uses NPM and Bower package
managers instead of NuGet; and a Node.js-based development server and utilities.

To run the project, make sure that you have Node.js, Gulp and Bower installed on
your machine. Then install 3rd party packages by running (in console):

> npm install -g gulp  # Make sure that Gulp.js is installed globally
> npm install          # Install Node.js packages listed in the package.json file
> bower install        # Install client-side libraries listed in the bower.json file

To compile the project and start a lightweight development server run:

> gulp                 # or: gulp --production

Then open it in a browser: https://localhost:8080/

P.S.: This is just a front-end part of a web application. It can be paired with
a server-side part developed in a separate project.
