================================================================================

This is a cross-platform project. It uses NPM and Bower package managers
instead of NuGet, and a Node.js-based development server.

To run the project, make sure you have Node.js, gulp and bower installed on your
machine and run:

> npm install -g gulp  # Make sure that Gulp.js is installed globally
> npm install          # Install node.js packages listed in the ./package.json file
> bower install        # Install Bower packages listed in the ./bower.json file

To compile the project and start a lightweight dev server run:

> gulp                 # or: gulp --production
